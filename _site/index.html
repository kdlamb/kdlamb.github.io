          <h2>Hybrid Physics ML approaches for Aerosol and Cloud Microphysics</h2>
          <p><p>Improving representations of aerosol and cloud microphysics in atmospheric models is key to accurately predicting future changes in climate.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, I have been working as a research scientist at Columbia University, where I am investigating new 
hybrid-physics machine learning approaches for parameterizing aerosol and cloud microphysics for atmospheric models.</p>

          <h2>Global scale observations of aerosols.</h2>
          <p><p>Iron oxide combustion aerosols have recently been identified as an anthropogenic source of 
atmospheric absorption, and may provide an additional source of particulate iron 
to the oceans (where they could play a role in the biogeochemical cycle, ultimately impacting ocean uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere). 
However, the sources and atmospheric abundance of these aerosols is still highly uncertain.</p>

<p>To provide the first global scale atmospheric constraints on these aerosols I developed a new methodology to 
characterize these aerosols <em>in situ</em> and analyzed data sets from 102 research flights during the 
<a href="https://espo.nasa.gov/atom/content/ATom">NASA Atmospheric Tomography Mission</a> and the 
<a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/hippo">HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations</a> campaigns.</p>

<p>I presented on this work at the AMS Conference on Atmospheric Radiation:
<a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/15CLOUD15ATRAD/webprogram/Paper347136.html">Constraints on Anthropogenic Iron Oxide Aerosols on a Global Scale</a>
and a paper on this research is currently under review.</p>

          <h2>NASA Frontier Development Lab</h2>
          <p><p>Machine learning is a promising tool for providing new insights into important scientific challenges.</p>

<p>I spent 8 weeks in Mountain View, CA, as a researcher during the 2019 <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/">NASA Frontier Development Lab</a>, a research sprint to apply AI to earth and space science challenges. 
I worked with the <a href="https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/2019-gnss">Forecasting Geoeffectiveness team</a> to develop a state-of-the-art data-driven machine learning approach for the prediction of space weather phenomena. 
Our team received the Unexpected Discovery Award for investigating how the aurora correlates with GNSS phase scintillations at high latitudes. We presented our work during the NASA FDL Show Case at Google Cloud HQ and at the Neurips 2019 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop:<br />

          <h2>Machine learning for in situ aerosol measurements</h2>
          <p><p>Aerosols (small particulate matter) play an important role in the atmosphere, impacting both air quality and climate. 
Recently I been exploring how advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning can be used to improve the classification and characterization of aerosols measured <em>in situ</em>.</p>

<p>I published work on improving the classification of absorbing aerosols:
<a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/12/3885/2019/">Classification of iron oxide aerosols with a single particle soot photometer using supervised machine learning.</a></p>

<p>I have also been exploring deep learning approaches to classifying black carbon aerosol morphology and presented initial results as a 
paper at the Neurips 2019 <em>Tackling Climate Change with AI Workshop</em>:

          <h2>NOAA Firelab</h2>
          <p><p>Forest fires are a major source of both primary and secondary atmospheric aerosols that impact both air quality and climate. Biomass burning aerosols such as 
black carbon and brown carbon are important contributors to climate direct radiative forcing. 
During the <a href="https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/firex/firelab/">NOAA 2016 Firelab Laboratory Study</a> at the 
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rmrs/research-labs/missoula-fire-sciences-laboratory">USDA Fire Sciences Lab</a>, 
I spent 2 months in Missoula, MT studying how absorbing aerosols emitted from biomass burning 
can be characterized <em>in situ</em>. I collaborated with researchers from NOAA’s Chemical Sciences Division on experiments
focused on a better characterization and understanding of the optical properties of black and brown carbon sourced from biomass burning.</p>

<p>Several papers have been published on these experiments so far:<br />

          <h2>Black Carbon sources in East Asia</h2>
          <p><p>Since East Asia is the most significant anthropogenic source region for black carbon (BC) aerosol, an important short-lived climate forcer, 
my research during the KORUS-AQ campaign focused on providing new observational constraints 
on the atmospheric abundance and vertical distribution of BC in East Asia. 
The optical properties of BC evolve in the atmosphere, impacting both its climate effects 
and atmospheric lifetime.</p>

<p>I published an overview of these new observations of BC over S. Korea in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres</em>:</p>

          <p><p>I participated in the field deployment of the NASA-NIER Korean-United States Air Quality Study, <a href="https://espo.nasa.gov/korus-aq">NASA KORUS-AQ</a>, 
carried out in Korea in Spring of 2016. This aircraft campaign was an international effort to improve understanding of air quality in 
East Asia.</p>

          <p><p>From 2016-2020, I worked as a research scientist at the <a href="https://cires.colorado.edu">Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences</a> 
at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, CO. 
My research focused on the sources, optical properties, and atmospheric lifetime of black carbon (BC).
BC is an aerosol (small particulate matter) emitted during incomplete combustion processes,
from both natural (forest fires) and anthropogenic (vehicle exhaust) sources. 
BC is considered the most important short-lived climate forcer, since it strongly absorbs solar radiation, directly heating the atmosphere.</p>

<p>To better characterize this aerosol in the atmosphere, I took part in several laboratory and aircraft 
field measurements using single particle soot photometers, the state-of-the-art approach 
for <em>in situ</em> characterization of these aerosols.</p>

          <h2>Water Isotopologues.</h2>
          <p><p>The isotopic composition of water is an important tracer of geophysical and atmospheric processes,
as the preferential deposition of heavy water as ice can provide information about both the
sources of water and its past history.</p>

<p>My doctoral thesis focused on experimental characterization of isotopic water vapor at low temperatures
as a tracer of cirrus cloud microphysics. This research provided the first experimental verification of the isotopic fractionation factors of water vapor at
low temperatures, in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the upper atmosphere, and was published in <em>PNAS</em>:</p>

          <h2>Cirrus Cloud Microphysics</h2>
          <p><p>Stratospheric water vapor acts as a green house gas, with important implications for climate. Cirrus clouds in the upper tropical tropopause layer (TTL) 
regulate the amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere. 
Because the TTL is very cold and dry, water vapor in these conditions is very challenging to measure accurately from aircraft and balloon platforms. 
During my Ph.D. I worked on the design, construction, and implementation of a mid-infrared spectroscopic instrument 
used to measure atmospheric water vapor in conditions characteristic of the TTL.</p>

<p>To characterize this instrument in realistic atmospheric conditions, I participated in several research campaigns at the 
<a href="https://www.imk-aaf.kit.edu/73.php">AIDA Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere Chamber</a> at KIT.
Aquavit II focused on comparing state-of-the-art aircraft instrumentation for measuring atmospheric water vapor over a range of different conditions. 
The IsoCloud campaign focused on characterizing ice growth in ultra-cold cirrus clouds.</p>

<p>A paper discussing the instrument we developed is here:
