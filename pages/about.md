I am currently an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University in the <a href="https://gentinelab.eee.columbia.edu/people">Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering</a> and an Affiliate of the <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/people/kara-lamb/">Data Science Institute</a>. I received my M.S. and Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago, where I was an NSF and NDSEG fellow. Following my Ph.D., I was a researcher in the Chemical Sciences Division at NOAAâ€™s Earth System Research Laboratory, where I was on the science team for the NASA KORUS-AQ and AToM aircraft campaigns and the NOAA FIREX Firelab Study, researching the sources of absorbing aerosols, their optical properties, and their direct climate effects. My current research lies at the intersection of observations (from laboratory and field studies) and high-resolution modeling, with the goal of better understanding how aerosols and clouds impact the climate. I combine traditional process-based approaches with data science and machine learning. I am the PI on a <a href="https://asr.science.energy.gov/projects/16120"> DOE project to study depositional ice growth in cirrus clouds </a> and co-PI on a project funded by the Zegar Family Foundation to use AI to optimize cloud seeding to reduce the risk of wildfires in the Western United States. I am also co-leading a project on ice microphysics through the <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu">NSF Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics Center</a> and collaborate with researchers at <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov">NASA GISS</a> on the NASA Digital Twins for Climate Science Project.
